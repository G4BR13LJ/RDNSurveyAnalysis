# 📝 Survey Analysis: RDN Website Design & User Engagement

This project explores how users perceive and engage with a nonprofit organization's website—specifically, the RDN (Regional Development Network). The goal was to assess user attitudes toward design features like homepage layout, social media presence, and color relevance, while also uncovering any demographic or experiential patterns (e.g., rural background or prior contact with nonprofits).

The analysis is built in Python and uses **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to process and visualize survey results.

## 📊 Key Objectives

- **Quantify user engagement** with the RDN website based on UI features.
- **Explore the importance of branding elements**, such as color usage and homepage video presence.
- **Assess perceived clarity** around RDN’s mission (e.g., support for unhoused individuals).
- **Analyze subgroup behavior** (e.g., rural vs. non-rural respondents).
- **Evaluate correlations** between web design features and perceived usefulness or engagement.

## 🧠 What’s in the Code

### `survey_analysis.py`
This script includes:
- **Boxplots**: Visualize how engagement and perception vary based on awareness of RDN’s mission.
- **Bar Charts**: Show response distributions for:
  - Indigenous color association
  - Homepage video usefulness
  - Social media’s role in brand validation
- **Heatmaps**: Explore correlations between numeric questions and background data (like rural status).
