# 🧠 RDN Website UX + Branding Survey Analysis

This repository presents a Python-based data analysis project aimed at uncovering how users perceive and interact with a nonprofit organization's website. The focus is on **user engagement**, **branding effectiveness**, and **UX-driven behavior**, using real survey data and Python visualization libraries.

> 📌 **Why this matters to you as an employer:**  
> This project demonstrates my ability to conduct **user-centered research**, perform **statistical analysis**, and communicate findings visually — all critical skills for roles in **data science**, **UX research**, or **digital strategy**.

## 🔍 Project Summary

I designed and analyzed a survey targeting public users of the [Regional Development Network (RDN)](https://example.com). The goal was to understand how people perceive website elements like:

- 🎨 **Color relevance** (esp. Indigenous color symbolism)
- 🎥 **Homepage video impact**
- 📱 **Social media trust signals**
- 🌐 **Clarity of mission and values**

The analysis identifies patterns in responses based on demographic info (e.g., rural vs. urban), prior nonprofit exposure, and overall user engagement.
