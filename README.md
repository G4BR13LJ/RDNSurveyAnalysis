## üîç Project Summary

I designed and analyzed a survey targeting public users of the [Regional Development Network (RDN)](https://example.com). The goal was to understand how people perceive website elements like:

-  **Color relevance** (esp. Indigenous color symbolism)
-  **Homepage video impact**
-  **Social media trust signals**
-  **Clarity of mission and values**

The analysis identifies patterns in responses based on demographic info (e.g., rural vs. urban), prior nonprofit exposure, and overall user engagement.
